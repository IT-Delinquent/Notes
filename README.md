# Notes
### A small cross-platform app for taking notes

This is my first ever Xamarin.Forms app, so be nice ðŸ˜¶ It's a simple application for creating, editing and deleting notes. You can also 
assign a color to your notes... because why not? ðŸŒˆ

Here are the main "features" of my app:

 - Create notes
 - Edit notes
 - Delete notes
 - Assign defining colors to notes
 - Sort the notes based on multiple attributes (including color)
 - Delete all your notes
 
 Here is a little GIF of my app. Hopefully, I keep this updated but I currently don't know how to maintain version numbers 
 for the app ðŸ¤£ðŸ‘¶
 
 I still want to add some things to the app, polish it a bit more and make it more efficient. Feel free to take this code and abuse it however
 you see fit ðŸ˜‡
